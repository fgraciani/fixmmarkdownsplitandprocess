## Initial Download and Setup

FIXM Extensions can be applied to Core, Applications, or both. Which
FIXM product(s) you begin with is entirely based on the scope of your
Extension.

1.  Determine which FIXM product(s) you wish to target with your
    Extension.

2.  Download the appropriate full release from
    <https://fixm.aero/download.pl>.

3.  Unzip the full release and navigate to the “uml” directory.

4.  Rename the .eap file to something appropriate for your Extension.

5.  Open the model (the .eap file) with Sparx Enterprise Architect[32]
    (EA).

For this guided example, the extension will target both Core and
BasicMessage (download available at
<https://fixm.aero/release.pl?rel=Basic-Msg-1.0.0>). The .eap file
should be renamed to
“FIXM\_Example\_Extension\_v1.0.0\_with\_Basic\_Message\_v1.0.0\_and\_Core\_v4.2.0.eap”.
The starting basic directory structure for the example environment is
shown below.
