## Purpose and content

This document provides guidance and clarifications for the
implementation of FIXM. It aims to build a "community knowledge" about
the implementation of FIXM. It will therefore evolve over time in order
to capture more alternatives, options and recommendations related to the
use of FIXM.

The implementation guidance provided in this document is structured as
follows:

-   **General Guidance on FIXM implementation**

> This chapter provides general guidance for understanding the main FIXM
> components, outlines general requirements for valid FIXM core and FIXM
> extensions usage and describes the general rules (encoding rules, data
> plausibility rules, rules for absent dataâ€¦) that are always applicable
> whatever the implementation context.

-   **Guidance for** **Using FIXM in Support of FF-ICE**

> This chapter provides specific guidance in support of the
> implementation of FF-ICE using FIXM. It introduces the FF-ICE
> Application Library, identifies a candidate set of FIXM-Based services
> enabling (part of) the information exchanges defined by the ICAO
> ATMRPP in the Manual on FF-ICE Implementation Guidance \[10\] and
> provides detailed examples of FF-ICE/R1 Services realizations.

-   **Guidance for** **Translating FF-ICE FIXM Messages to ATS
    Messages**

> This chapter defines a formal mapping between the FIXM Logical Model
> and Air Traffic Services (ATS) message content as defined in ICAO Doc
> 4444 \[8\].

-   **Guidance for** **Using FIXM for other use cases**

> This chapter provides guidance for using FIXM in a context other than
> FF-ICE. In particular, it helps FIXM implementers create their own
> application libraries and extensions.

*Note: The present version of the document captures the guidance
information agreed by the FIXM community as of March 2018. Readers are
invited to monitor the FIXM community discussions in the FIXM Work Area*
*\[6\] about the implementation of FIXM, which may serve as useful
complement or clarification.*
