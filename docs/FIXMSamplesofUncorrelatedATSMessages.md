## FIXM Samples of Uncorrelated ATS Messages

The initial set of samples contained FIXM representation of multiple
messages of types Flight Plan (FPL), Change (CHG), Delay (DLA), and
Cancel (CNL). These are uncorrelated messages, in the sense that they
are not based on one or several particular flights, and each one is
interpreted individually.

The input data for the samples was “sanitized” to not show actual flight
IDs, airline codes, or pilot names. In addition, they do not contain any
references to any other messages in the set.
