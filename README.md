# FIXM User Manual

This document provides guidance and clarifications for the implementation of FIXM. It includes general guidance for the implementation of FIXM (high-level considerations about the usage of FIXM, general encoding rules...) and more specific FIXM guidance and examples in support of FF-ICE/R1 and of the transition to FF-ICE/R1.

This Guidance Document, which is managed by the FIXM CCB, is released as a recommended practice for FIXM. It is therefore non-normative. Requirements described in it shall be considered mandatory only for those aiming to comply with this guidance.

This document aims to build a "community knowledge" about the implementation of FIXM. It will therefore evolve over time in order to capture more alternatives, options and recommendations related to the use of FIXM. Suggested additions, changes and comments on this document are welcome and encouraged. These suggestions should be sent to the FIXM CCB (<FIXM.CCB@eurocontrol.int>) or posted to the FIXM Work Area.

The present version of the document provides guidance for the implementation of **FIXM v4.2.0**.
